CRITs (Collaborative Research Into Threats) is an open source malware and threat repository that leverages other open source software to create a unified tool for analysts and security experts engaged in threat defense. It began as a project at The MITRE Corporation in 2010 to enhance and support internal CND operations. Since then it has grown into a large community of users, developers, and organizations. CRITs gives the security community a flexible and open platform for analyzing and sharing threat data. It provides organizations around the world with the capability to quickly adapt to an ever-changing threat landscape.
