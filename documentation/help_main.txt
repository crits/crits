Concepts
-------------------------------------------

A certain level of experience with Information Security is required
to make proper use of CRITs. What follows are short explanations of
concepts that are used in the world of CRITs. These are not meant
to be exhaustive definitions. Instead, think of it as a Rosetta Stone
to ensure that your own concepts and experience match the terms used
in the system.

**Activity**
   Activity is used to describe when an Indicator was identified, whether it be
   from log analysis or sensors being tripped. It allows you to develop a
   timeline for that Indicator.

**Bucket List**
   Bucket lists are simply an analog of the common tag; they are used
   to group together objects that have a possible relationship. For
   instance, buckets can be used to quickly mark patterns for further
   study at a later time. This is a handy way of marking your \"gut\"
   instincts as you are viewing objects.

**Campaign**
   When common, malicious behavior is repeated or when a single
   resource is repeatedly targeted, this is called a campaign.
   Identifying campaigns can give your organization insight into
   everything from APT identification to how to focus your intrusion
   prevention efforts.

**Certificate**
   Certificates are top-level objects. They are anything from Server/Client
   certificates to signing certificates.

**Domain**
  Domains are top-level objects. They allow you to track and relate domains and
  sub-domains with other top-level objects like IPs and Certificates.

**Event**
   An event is a collection of related content within CRITs which may or may not
   be attributed to a known campaign.

**Indicator**
   Indicators are pieces of metadata with a confidence and impact value
   associated with them. They help determine the reaction level an organization
   should have if that metadata is noticed anywhere on their network.

**IP**
  IPs are top-level objects used for relating to Domains. It helps to show a
  timeline of what IPs were associated with a domain and when domains were
  active/parked.

**Object**
   Objects are pieces of information extracted while performing analysis on a
   top-level object such as a Sample or PCAP.

**PCAP**
   PCAPs are files containing network traffic. Usually PCAPs contain things like
   Samples and Emails but can also be used for populating Domains, IPs, and
   Indicators.

**Relationship**
   A relationship is defined between two or more top-level objects  when they
   share a common trait. For instance, a direct relationship exists
   between a Domain and its IP address, so you may choose to define a
   relationship between each of these objects that would otherwise
   be independent. Relationships can be either horizontal (as in the
   above example) or vertical (as in hierarchical). CRITs supports
   relationships as defined in the CybOX specification. Each object
   has a \"child\" object in which related objects are declared.

**Sample**
  Samples are binaries which you want to perform some level of analysis on due
  to their potential for being malicious.

**Source**
   Source is the term used to refer, very simply, to the intelligence
   source from which an object was imported. Alternatively, they
   can be considered as organizational units or buckets. Each
   object in CRITs needs to be attributed to a source, This allows
   you to get a better overall picture not only of the environment
   that the source represents, but a better feel for how reliable the
   object are from a particular source.

   Sources are specified by your administrator, and there is no
   universal \"right way\" to define them. Having a solid
   understanding of how your organization defines sources will ensure
   that your own efforts will be compliant.

Keyboard Shortcuts
-------------------------------------------
In order to expedite navigation, CRITs has built-in keyboard
shortcuts available after clicking on the `Navigation Menu`_. Below
is a list of these shortcuts. Note that the shortcuts are case
sensitive.

        :a: `Advanced Search`_
        :d: Add a Domain
        :e: Add an Email
        :E: Add an Event
        :i: Add an Indicator
        :I: Add an IP Address
        :n/m: Open the Navigation Menu
        :p: Add a PCAP
        :s: Add a Sample

Advanced Search
-------------------------------------------
The Advanced Search dialog can be accessed by clicking on the \"Hourglass\"
icon next to the search box in the upper right corner. This will
allow you to search for items based on a number of criteria. Entering
a term into any of the fields will search all of the fields of that
type of indicator. For example, entering \"Bob\" into the \"Email\"
field will return all emails that mention \"Bob\" in either the
header or the body of the message.

Table Navigation
-------------------------------------------

The tables that are displayed in CRITs use several common user
interface conventions to enhance usability.

* Rows can be sorted by a column by clicking on the column name.
* Use drop down menus on the table header and footer to change the
   current page number or the number of rows to display on the table.
* The arrows on the left side of both the table header and footer
   allow you to navigate from page to page or to jump to the end or
   beginning page.
* Clicking the "Reload" button will refresh the data in the table.
* Text on the right side of both the header and footer show you how
   many records are displayed out of the total data set.

First-Time Use
===========================================

Browser Compatibility
-------------------------------------------

CRITs works in most modern browsers, with support for the following:

* Chrome
* Firefox 23.0 and later
* IE 8 and later

Note that IE 9 users may experience some rendering issues. If so, do
the following:

1. Open Internet Explorer.
2. Hit F12 or select the IE tool icon in the upper right corner and choose
   \"Developer Tools\".
3. In the new panel that opens at the bottom of the screen, change
   \"Document Mode: IE9 Standards\" to \"Internet Explorer 9
   Standards (Page Default)\".

Logging Into CRITs
-------------------------------------------

When you browse to your CRITs instance you will be greeted with a Login page.
From here you can authenticate or get assistance with resetting your password.

Your administrator should provide you with a username, password, and
URL for logging into CRITs. If not, please contact your
administrator; you will be unable to proceed without this
information.

Once logged in, you will be greeted with your Dashboard. It's a good
idea, at this point, to change your temporary password. For more
information, see `How to Change Your Password`_. Remember, a system
can only be as secure as its least secure user!

The UI
===========================================

UI Layout
-------------------------------------------

There are five pieces of the UI that are always available to you no matter what
page you are on:

1. The top bar which contains:

    1. The Gear image, from which you can access the `Navigation Menu`_.
    2. Your `Profile Information`_.
    3. Your `Assigned Role`_.
    4. `Search Bar`_.

2. The bottom bar which contains:

    1. `Host and Instance information`_.
    2. Your `Last Login Date`_.
    3. The `Security Classification`_ of this CRITs instance.
    4. `Copyright Information`_.

3. The Navigation menu.
4. The Advanced Search menu.
5. The content area between the top and bottom bar.

The following sections describe each of these areas in more detail.

Navigation Menu
-------------------------------------------

The Gear icon in the top left corner of the screen is the easiest
means of navigating through CRITs. Each item in the menu is a
hyperlink that will take you to the relevant section of the system.

Clicking any of the \"+\" icons will allow you to quickly create an
item of the relevant kind. For instance, click the \"+\" next to the
\"IP\" menu item allows you to quickly create a new IP-type
indicator.

Profile Information
-------------------------------------------

To assist in the easier identification of users, CRITs includes
several profile fields that help to identify you to other users in
your instance. Clicking the link will bring you to your `User Profile
Page`_.

Assigned Role
-------------------------------------------

This section simply lists the role that has been assigned to you by
your administrator. These roles are fully customizable, so your
individual experience will vary.

Search Bar
-------------------------------------------

The search bar acts as a universal query tool that will query the
entire CRITs database for the term entered. This can be useful when
for quick access to any item by name or content. This is also known
as the "Global Search Box"

Host and Instance Information
-------------------------------------------

The host and instance information sections display information set by
your administrator that helps to confirm that you are using the
intended system. It is a good idea to ask your administrator the
expected values of these items to provide a modicum of identity
confirmation.

Last Login Date
-------------------------------------------

This are simply displays the last date upon which you logged into the
system. This can be useful as a point of basic security; seeing that
you logged on during your vacation, for instance, is a sign that
either your credentials were misused or that you work too hard.


Security Classification
-------------------------------------------

Like the host and instance information, the security classification
is used to denote the classification level of the contents of the
system. U.S. government entities or their contractors, for instance,
may operate an instance that is classified as \"Secret\". As a best
practice, the default value for this should be "Unclassified".

Copyright Information
-------------------------------------------

Text marking the U.S. copyright information of CRITs.

User Profile Page
===========================================

The User Profile page can be reached from any section of CRITs by
clicking on your username in the upper left corner. You can also get
to this page by going to "My CRITs" in the navigation menu. On this page, you
will find a number of personalization options, usage history, and
subscription information.

User Info Tab
-------------------------------------------
This tab displays information about your account and general usage.
Most importantly, this is where you will find the change password
functionality. See `How to Change Your Password`_ for more
information.

Login Attempts Tab
-------------------------------------------
This tab presents you with a table of all of your recent login
attempts. Information such as user agent (i.e. browser), IP, and date
are all available.

Recent Activity Tab
-------------------------------------------

This tab presents you with a table of all of your recent activity in
the system.

Subscriptions Tab
-------------------------------------------
This tab lists your current subscriptions.

My Source Tab
-------------------------------------------
This tab lists the current information sources to which you have
access. Only items associated with these sources will be visible
within CRITs. You can also check a box next to each source which
will subscribe you to any and all content associated with that source
going forward.

Notifications Tab
-------------------------------------------
This tab lists all of your existing notifications. You can remove individual
notifications, or clear them all. Note that by visiting the details page of
any top-level object, it will clear any notifications you have for it
automatically.

access. The table on this page shows, by default, the first 25
indicators sorted by date added. See `Table Navigation`_ for more
information on how to interact with the table.

Adding a New Indicator
-------------------------------------------
There are two common ways to add a new indicator to CRITs:

        1. Open the `Navigation Menu`_ and click the cross symbol
           next to \"Events\". You may also click on either of the
           following options that will appear in a sub-menu to the
           right: "New Indicator Blob" or "New Indicator CSV"
        2. From the `Indicator Page`_, click the \"Add Indicator\"
           button.

Doing either of these will open a new dialog box that allows you to
define a new indicator. An indicator consists of eight pieces of
information, as follows:

:Indicator Type: Choose the type of indicator from the drop-down.
        Additional types may be available by clicking "More Object
        Types" at the bottom of the window.
:Value: Define the value for the indicator
:Confidence: Select the confidence level for the indicator
:Impact: Select the level of impact for the indicator
:Campaign: (Optional) Select a campaign with which to associate the
        indicator
:Campaign Confidence: (Optional) Select a confidence level for the
        association with the campaign
:Source: From the drop-down, select the source of the indicator
:Reference: (Optional) Reference for the indicator
:Bucket List: This is a list of buckets you want to associate with this
    Indicator.

.. Note:: Athough the "Confidence" and "Campaign Confidence" fields
        may be defined individually by your organization (or, indeed,
        have custom values set by your administrator), it is useful
        to have a "default" rating suggestion. Therefore, proposed
        meanings for the respective ratings follow.

        **Confidence (Indicator)**
                :Unknown: The indicator has not been seen before, nor
                        has it been reported by a trusted source;
                        this is used to mark "hunches" that require
                        confirmation.
                :Benign: The indicator is known to be false, and
                        should be ignored when identifying malware.
                :Low: The indicator has not been seen, but comes from
                        a medium- or high-confidence source.
                :Medium: The indicator has been confirmed and/or it
                        comes from a high-confidence source.
                :High: The indicator has been confirmed multiple
                        times.

        **Campaign Confidence**
                :Low: The campaign is not well defined and/or the
                        indicator is not directly related to any
                        other associated indicator.
                :Medium: The campaign is confirmed and/or the
                        indicator directly relates to another,
                        associated indicator.
                :High: The campaign is confirmed and well-known
                        and/or the indicator is directly related to
                        more than one other indicator associated
                        with the campaign.

Once these fields are filled out, press \"Upload Indicator\". You should

        3. Enter in your old password, new password, and confirm your
           new password.
        4. Click "Submit".

API
===========================================

CRITs comes with an authenticated API. The API leverages Tastypie. A lot of the
features of Tastypie are overridden by CRITs code for our needs. More
information on Tastypie can be found here:

        http://tastypieapi.org/

Users can visit their profile page and generate API keys for their necessary
tasks. Each API key can be revoked if that key becomes compromised or the user
no longer wishes to use it.

If you are using a web browser to access the API and you have an
authenticated CRITs session already, you do not have to provide
authentication information to utilize the API. To provide authentication
information, append the following to your requests:

        &username=<username>&api_key=<api_key>

Where <username> is your username, and <api_key> is the API key you wish to use.

API URLs
-------------------------------------------
The URL structure for the API comes in this form:

/api/<version>/<resource>/...

The <version> comes in the form of v# where # is the API version you
are using.

The <resource> is the content you wish to utilize within CRITs.
Currently the available resources are:

- campaigns
- certificates
- domains
- emails
- events
- indicators
- ips
- pcaps
- raw_data
- samples
- targets
- standards

For example, if you wanted to get a list of campaigns, you would use:

        /api/v1/campaigns/

This would return a list of campaigns in JSON format. If you wish to change
the format to something else, you would append "?format=<format>" where <format>
is the format you want the data returned to you in. We currently support the
following formats:

- json
- yaml
- xml
- stix

If you choose the stix format, you will get a single stix document from the API
which contains all of the objects returned from that API call.

If you wish to get information about a single document, you would use:

        /api/v1/campaigns/<object_id>/

If the results of the GET request have a file in GridFS, you can download them
by appending "?file=1" on the end. *By default the file(s) will be returned to
you in raw format.* If you wish to adjust which format the files are in when
sent to you, you can append "&file_format=<format>" where <format> is one of
'base64', 'zlib', and 'invert'. The result will be a zip file with a password
of 'infected' containing all of the files found with your GET request. If you
query for just a single document you will still get a zip file with the same
password. If there is an issue generating the zip file (whether due to no files
being found, or some other error) you will get a non-zip file which contains any
issues.

Queries against the API are done via GET requests. If you wish to upload content
to the system through the API, you must use a POST.

Searching Using GET Parameters
-------------------------------------------

If you wish to limit the results of your GET request by the value of one or more
fields, you can do so by adding more parameters. The format is similar to how
you use search operators in the global search box. Here's an example:

        /api/v1/samples/?c-campaign.name=Bad Guys&c-filename=foo.txt

You'll notice a couple things here. The first is that there is a "c-" in front
of the field name. This tells the API that this parameter should be used as a
field to search against to limit your results. Second is that there is no
operators for defining AND or OR. Currently this only supports AND operations.
In our example, only samples with a Campaign Name of "Bad Guys" AND a filename
of "foo.txt" will be returned to us. Finally, in this format the fields are both
full matches.

As long as you have a "c-" in front of the parameter, you can search against any
field in the database, whether it is a CRITs supported field or not!

If you wish to use regex, you can add "&regex=1". This will convert *all* "c-"
parameters to regex searches (except those with comparison operators which is
explained below).

        /api/v1/samples/?c-campaign.name=Bad&c-filename=foo&regex=1

This will find all Samples where the filename contains "foo" and the Campaign Name
contains "Bad".

If you wish to use the MongoDB comparison operators ('gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte',
'in', 'nin'), you can use the syntax "__<operator>" when defining your field.
Some examples:

        /api/v1/samples/?c-size__lte=100

        /api/v1/samples/?c-bucket_list__in=foo,bar

:Note: Using a comparison operator will override "&regex=1" so none of the fields which use comparison operators will be converted into regex.

Limiting GET Request Results
-------------------------------------------

If you wish to limit the fields in the results of your GET request, you can use
two features:

:only: Only populate these and any required fields.
:exclude: Do not populate these fields if they are not required.

For example:

        /api/v1/samples/?only=filename,mimetype,md5

Will only populate those and any required fields for each document. The
inclusion of required fields is intentional. The classes expect that these
fields are populated if they are required and do not have a default value to set,
so if you do not include them they will complain.

You can combine both only and exclude. The result will be all of the fields from
only as long as they aren't in the exclude list, combined with any required
fields.


Examples:
-------------------------------------------

cURL:

        curl -F "filedata=@/path/to/file.pcap" -F "source=<your source>" http://localhost:1337/api/v1/pcaps/\?username\=<your username>\&api_key\=<your api key>

POST Responses
-------------------------------------------

In most cases when submitting a POST to add new content to CRITs you will
get a response in the following JSON format:

        | {
        |   "return_code": <code>,
        |   "type": <type>,
        |   "id": <object_id>,
        |   "message": <message>,
        |   "url": <url>
        | }

The return_code is usually 0 for success, 1 for failure. Some API calls may
wish to extend this to include other codes to represent other results. Those
return codes should be listed in the appropriate sections below.

In the event a new TLO was created or content was successfully added to an
existing TLO, the TLO type and ID will be returned to you. In addition, a
URL will be provided which can be used to query the API for the details of
that TLO.

If there is a message to give context, whether the request was successful or
not, it will also be provided.

In some situations the entire response may not look like this. Refer to the
sections below for any special conditions you may need to look out for.
